# Pathfinder
My pathfinding application was written in Java with the JavaFX library for visuals. It allows the user to have a visual representation on how a select algorithm operates. Currently there are two viable algorithms within the application, A* and Flood. The user can place two points on the graph and build barriers to obstruct the AI.
